# SH2 (No-RTOS) DSF Logger over FTDI 

DSF Logger configures and communicates with the SensorHub (SH2) in SHTP over UART protocol through the FTDI interface. A group of sensors will be enabled based on the operating mode and rate specified. 
The output SH2 sensor reports will be saved to a log file in DSF format.

## Requirements

* SensorHub (BNO080, FSP200, etc.) with the FTDI Adapter 
* CMAKE 
* Visual Studio (for Windows) 

## Setup

* Clone this repository using the --recursive flag with git:
```
git clone --recursive http://github.hcrest.com/hillcrest/sh2-nortos-ftdi-dsf.git
```

* Adjust the receive buffer latency timer. Reduce the latency timer from the default value of 16 milliseconds to 1 millisecond. 
** For Windows application, the latency timer has been adjusted automatically. 
** For Linux, use the following examples, assuming the device is connected to the ttyUSB0 serial port.
```
# cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
16
# echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
# cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
1
```

## Building from Source

Run CMAKE to generate the makefile. CMAKE detects the platform which is run on (Windows/Linux) to generate the correct makefile.
```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
```

For Windows, open the generated solution (sh2_ftdi_logger.sln) in the Visual Studio to build the application.

For Linux, run MAKE to compile and build the application.
```
make -f Makefile
```

## Running the application
```
Usage: sh2_ftdi_logger.exe <out.dsf> [--deviceNumber=<id>] [--rate=<rate>] [--raw] [--calibrated] [--uncalibrated] [--mode=<9agm,6ag,6am,6gm,3a,3g,3m,all>] [--dcdAutoSave] [--calEnable=0x<mask>]
   out.dsf              - output dsf file
   --deviceNumber=<id>  - which device to open.  0 for a single device.
   --rate=<rate>        - requested sampling rate for all sensors.  Default: 100Hz
   --raw                - include raw data and use SAMPLE_TIME for timing
   --calibrated         - include calibrated output sensors
   --uncalibrated       - include uncalibrated output sensors
   --mode=<mode>        - sensors types to log.  9agm, 6ag, 6am, 6gm, 3a, 3g, 3m or all.
   --dcdAutoSave        - enable DCD auto saving.  No dcd save by default.
   --clearDcd           - clear DCD and reset upon startup.
   --calEnable=0x<mask> - cal enable mask.  Bits: Planar, A, G, M.  Default 0x8
```

| **_3m_** | | MAGNETIC_FIELD_CALIBRATED | MAGNETIC_FIELD_UNCALIBRATED | RAW_MAGNETOMETER |

### Examples 

Run DSF logger in '6ag' mode to enable the GameRV sensors along with the associated raw sensor reports. 
The SensorHub device is connected to /dev/ttyUSB2.

```
sh2_ftdi_logger.exe out_2.dsf --deviceNumber=2 --raw --mode=6ag
```
